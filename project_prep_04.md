## Project Description

### Jobs recommendation and application management app

- A concierge service that works across three job sites (LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster).

- Problems solve => save time to the user and provide alerts.

- A react app would allow users to manage the status of their job applications (i.e. pending, interviews scheduled, jobs declined). 

The react app would use a regular CRUD functionality using a django backend app to manage the jobs. 

It would also show a basic statistical graph using D3.js of jobs that the user applied for over time.

It would also recommend jobs by scraping sites like LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster 

The scraper functionality can be on a django backend app that would populate the database.

It would use two models, the userâ€™s jobs model and the recommended app model.

It would use two django apps, one for scraper and the other one for CRUD functionality.

Stretch Goals
The react app would also recommend a job listing using machine learning that would recommend job opening to users.
