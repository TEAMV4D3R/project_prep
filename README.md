# Crucible
Welcome to Crucible, the site that allows users to organize their job search! Crucible includes features that allow users to add information about their job search, search for jobs, and even chat with other job searchers! If you would like a demonstration of the Crucible application, feel free to take a look at our demonstration video [here] beginning at timestamp 23:30! The main Crucible Site is deployed at https://mycrucible.netlify.app/ although it is not yet open to the public while we implement secure Google Authentication for login. Please check back soon!

## Main Folder Help
In the main folder, there are several repositories related to this application. There is of course the [Next.JS frontend](https://github.com/TEAMV4D3R/nextjs-frontend-crucible#readme), as well as two seperate backends, one each for the [user job notes](https://github.com/TEAMV4D3R/django-backend-crucible/blob/main/README.md) and [user job search data schema](https://github.com/TEAMV4D3R/django-scraping-backend#readme), plus the separate repository that houses the [data scraper](https://github.com/TEAMV4D3R/scraper#readme). Each repository has its own README file that elaborates on the contents of the individual folders.
