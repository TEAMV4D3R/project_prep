## Project Plan
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, we plan to approach the day-to-day work by having team standups and code reviews on a daily basis to review changes and align tasks for the upcoming work.

## Conflict Plan
- Process to resolve conflict
- Discuss issues as they arise rather than waiting.
- If a majority of the team agreed on conflict resolution, then conflict is resolved.
- If we cannot resolve the conflict amongst ourselves, we will bring in an outside party to talk through it with the team.
- If one person takes over the project, it is the responsibility of the other team members to follow the conflict plan and address the situation.
- As team members we will leverage each other's strengths,while balancing what we want to get out of the project and completing the work in a timely manner.
- In cases where we have knowledge gaps and not enough time to learn, we will together decide the balance between learning and coding. We will review written code during daily standups to make sure that all team members understand the codebase.
- If a member is not adequately contributing, the other team members will have a respectful conversation to understand the situation and ask for a change in output.

## Communication Plan
- Hours available
- Jacob: Class hours
- Jae: Class hours, plus before class pre-arranged. Not available Friday or Sunday. 
- JJ: Class hours.
- Pedro: Class hours, plus 2 hours prior to class pre-arranged. Available Friday from 3-6pm pre-arranged.
- Team will be fully available at class time, plus other pre-arranged times. The forms of communication include Slack and via text. We will take breaks as often as needed and will aim to take them hourly or when milestones are completed. The practice of open and mutual respect at all conversations will ensure that all voices are heard. We will create a safe environment by taking others' feedback and opinions into consideration and talking through things. We will also listen to team mates, empathize with their situation and try to see where they are coming from.
- Work Plan
- We will work together to break up tasks and track them using our project management tool for visibility of progress. The assignment of tasks may be based on individual strengths. If any of the team members encounter a task while working on the project that’s not in the Trello board, that team member will add that ticket to the board. If we start to fall behind the team will re-prioritize and split tasks differently or have team members work with others. Our project management tool for this project will be Trello.

 - Git Process
 - Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
 - All of our projects will reside on Github aside from the parts that are deployed on other sites and the workflow board which will reside on Trello.
 - Team members have been added as owners in our Github Organization Repo.
 - Git flow- The main and staging branches will be protected - We will review code with other team members before merging to the staging branch during project work that will require review by two other members of the team and aim to merge daily at the start and end of classes.
